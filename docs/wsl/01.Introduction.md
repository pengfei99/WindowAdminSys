# Introduction of wsl

**WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** is a compatibility layer developed by Microsoft that allows users to 
`run a Linux environment directly on Windowsâ€”without the need for a virtual machine` or dual-boot setup.

## Key Features

1. **Native Linux Kernel (WSL 2)**: includes a real Linux kernel running in a lightweight virtual machine, improving performance and compatibility with Linux software.

2. **Linux CLI Tools**: You can run bash, ssh, git, apt, vim, Python, and other command-line tools just like on a native Linux system.

3. **File Interoperability**: Linux can access Windows files (under /mnt/c/) and vice versa.

4. **Low Overhead**: WSL is more lightweight than full virtual machines and starts almost instantly.

5. **GUI App Support**: `WSLg (in Windows 11)` allows running Linux GUI apps seamlessly alongside Windows apps.

## Versions
- WSL 1: Translates Linux calls into Windows calls (no real Linux kernel).
- WSL 2: Uses a real Linux kernel in a lightweight VM for full system call compatibility.

## Use Cases

- Software development in Linux environments.
- Using Linux tools on Windows without a dual boot.
- Running containerized workloads (with Docker Desktop integration).
- Educational and testing environments.

## Important point **WSL is user-isolated by design**

Each Windows user has their own WSL environment:
- Separate Linux filesystem
- Separate environment variables
- Separate installed packages and services
